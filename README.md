## 👩‍🔬 About Me
I am an Honors College student at the University of Oklahoma pursuing a **B.S. in Engineering Physics** and a **B.M. in Vocal Performance**, with a combined GPA of **3.96**.  
My research and academic interests include:
- Cold atom systems for modeling condensed matter and biological phenomena  
- Quantum computing algorithms & simulation of many-body dynamics  
- Design of quantum devices with biomedical applications  

I strive to bridge **theoretical modeling** and **experimental implementation** in order to advance the next generation of quantum technologies.
